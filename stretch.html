    <h1>Stretch/Strength</h1>
    <h4>
          What was your strength at the beginning of the year? Do you feel this strength has remained the same throughout the year? Explain
      </h4>
      
      <p>My strength is my writing. I do feel like my strength has remained the same. However, I do feel like I have had one or two writing assignments that I feel did not showcase my strength to the best of my ability. I feel like the reason I did have these assignments is due to my time management. The way I will prevent this from happening in the future is I will start earlier and work on them at a steady pace and I will proofread for longer.</p>

          What was your stretch at the beginning of the year? Do you feel this stretch has remained the same throughout the year? Explain

      <p>
      My stretch is my organization. I do feel like my stretch has remained constant throughout the year. Some aspects I need to work on are the organization of my binder, notebooks, etc. more often and take the time to keep my items organized. The Habit of Mind I connect this to would be managing impulsivity because my current impulses would lead me to unoorganized items.</p>
      
      <h1>Goal</h1>
      
      <p>My goal at the beginning of the year was to achieve a 4.0 GPA in each trimester. The steps I took to achieve this goal have been regarding my time management and studying. I have spread out working on assignments, and have been studying more than I have in the past, especially before tests and quizzes. I will modify my plan for the rest of the year to make it more organization oriented. My new goal is to keep my school binder/supplies organized for the rest of the year. This will improve my grades, and help my time management. This again relates to the habit of mind of managing impulsivity because my current impulses in regards to organization are not where they should be, and I need to make orgnization the first impulse I have.</p>
