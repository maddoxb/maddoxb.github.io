  <h1>Question Responses</h1>
  <h3> My Friend Group</h3>
  <p>I feel my friend group is broad especially considering the size of the school. I try to include people in this friend group if they are willing to be included. I try to be friendly to everybody.</p>
  <h3>Leadership Role</h3>
  <p>A leadership role I have assumed this year has been on the school basketball team. I feel like this has taught me how to be a leader in a lower stress environment.</p>
  <h3>Schoolwork</h3>
  <p>I feel like I am consistent with completing work on time. However, I do feel like I should work on my time management. This is so I am prepared for high school.</p>
