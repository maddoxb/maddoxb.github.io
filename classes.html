          <h3>Artifacts</h3>
          
          <h4>Literature</h4>
          
          <p>The artifact that I chose for Literature was my Scarlet Letter poem. This represented my strength. I put my mind to writing this and planned out the writing of it and produced a higher quality project.</p>
          
          <h4>Social Studies</h4>
          
          <p>The artifact that I chose for Social Studies was my </p>
          
          <h4>Spanish</h4>
          
          <p>The artifact that I chose for Spanish was my Preterite v. Imperfect test. The reason I chose this was because I studied hard for it, and got one of the better grades in the class.</p>
          
          <h4>Math</h4>
          
          <p>The artifacts that I chose for Math were my notebook, a test, and a homework packet. These represent my improving organization on my homework  and notes translating into better results on my tests. A success that I have had in Math was working on log functions. These were my main stuggle last year, and this year I have improved on them.</p>
