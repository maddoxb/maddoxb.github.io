      <h3>Sports I Play</h3>
    <ul font-size: 20px>
      <li>Volleyball</li>     
      <li>Basketball</li>
      <li>Flag Football</li>
    </ul>

      <p>
      The sports I play have taught me about leadership. I have been in leadership roles on a few teams, and I have had good experiences in these roles. The Habit of Mind I connect this to is persisting because even if I am down big in a game, I still have to persist and try to get back in it.
